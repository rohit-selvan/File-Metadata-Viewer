# File-Metadata-Viewer

The File Metadata Viewer is a Python-based tool that allows users to easily extract and view metadata from various file types through a simple graphical interface. Built with Tkinter, this tool enables users to select any file and instantly display detailed metadata, such as file size, creation date, modification date, and file path. For image files, the tool extracts additional information, including image resolution, camera model, and other EXIF metadata.

The interface is designed with a clean and pastel-themed background, offering intuitive buttons for selecting files and exporting metadata to a text file for later use. This makes it a useful tool for quick metadata analysis and organization. Whether you want to verify image details or check the integrity of other files, this tool provides an easy way to access and save critical file information.
